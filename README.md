# WISEE__2410

- IP66, ISO 10816, two 3.6 batteries
- Device EUI, AppKey, AppEUI
- Class A (battery power, downlink avaialable after TX)
- 8 features each axis -> 24 features
- ISO 10816-3: mechanical vibraion on non-roating part
- ISO 10816: freqency (1kHz), vibration velocity RMS, evaluation zone, able to connect to cloud
- Raw data (g value) collected in spatial domain -> converted to vibration/accleration amplitude in freq domain with FFT -> abnomaly detection


# WISEE__4610
- Lora : radio modulation technology  ≠ LoraWAN: protocol
- OTAA (over-the-air-activation): DevEUI, AppEUI, AppKey  ≠ ABP (activation by personalization): DevAddr, NwkSkey, AppSkey
- Rechargeable with 10-50V power supply and switch on
- Support LoRaWAN and WISE-LINK(LoRa Private) -> use gateway WISE-3610
- S614 for AI data and S672; app-argument -> WISE-S672
